    "    - Copilot Edits lets you iterate quickly on code changes across multiple files using natural language prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Starting a Copilot Edits Session:\n",
    "    - Access the Copilot Edits view via:\n",
    "        - Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux)\n",
    "        - The Copilot menu in the VS Code title bar (select \"Open Copilot Edits\")\n",
    "        - The Command Palette using commands like \"View: Toggle Copilot Edits\"\n",
    "    - An edit session may consist of multiple iterative requests to refine your code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using Edit Mode:\n",
    "    - Steps to use Edit Mode:\n",
    "        1. Open the Copilot Edits view using the keyboard shortcut or menu.\n",
    "        2. Select \"Edit\" from the mode dropdown.\n",
    "        3. Add files to the working set by clicking \"Add Files\" or using the Attach icon.\n",
    "        4. Enter a clear and specific natural language prompt.\n",
    "            - Optionally, include `#codebase` in your prompt to let Copilot automatically locate relevant files.\n",
    "        5. Copilot Edits will stream code edits directly into the editor; files that are modified appear in bold.\n",
    "        6. Review the suggested changes and use the in-editor controls to Accept or Discard each edit.\n",
    "        7. Iterate with follow-up prompts if additional modifications are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Managing the Working Set:\n",
    "    - The working set is the collection of files that Copilot Edits can modify.\n",
    "    - You can add files by:\n",
    "        - Clicking \"Add Files\" or using the Attach icon (Ctrl+/ on Windows/Linux)\n",
    "        - Dragging and dropping editor tabs, files, or folders from the Explorer view\n",
    "        - Right-clicking a file in the Explorer and selecting \"Add File to Copilot Edits\"\n",
    "    - The working set is limited to 10 files. Files added to the working set will be highlighted when edits are applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Accepting, Discarding, and Undoing Edits:\n",
    "    - Copilot Edits provides an in-editor review workflow:\n",
    "        - Use the Accept or Discard controls (either individually or via the working setâ€™s \"Accept All\" or \"Discard All\" buttons)\n",
    "        - Editor overlay controls allow you to navigate between suggested changes.\n",
    "        - The \"Undo Last Edit\" control lets you revert recent changes, and you can redo them if needed.\n",
    "        - Pending edits are saved across VS Code sessions so you can review them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Transferring Chat Requests to Copilot Edits:\n",
    "    - From the Copilot Chat view, you can transfer a chat request to Copilot Edits by clicking the \"Edit with Copilot\" button.\n",
    "    - This moves the conversation to the Edits view, where the suggested code changes can be applied across multiple files.\n",
